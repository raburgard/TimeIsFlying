                  fair coquette 
bright wanderer, <str>very cha[???]</str> of heaven,
To whom alone it has been given
To change and be adored for ever......
Envy not this dim world, for never
But once within its shadow grew
    far     fans    so          to   ing  miser(?)
The    left      in    [??] the    sol?nf rim
when the moon had <str>cle</str> ceased to climb
           <str>faith?</str>
The a jars <str>d?mme?</str> of heaven <str> du?t</str>, strife
And film/kiln(?) on  although as leef(?)

                      fair    coquette of Heaven,
Bright wanderer, <st>ivory</st> <st>change</st> //Don't think it's "ivory;" that's not a Percy "i." living/loving maybe? Maybe it's a b.--VF
To whom alone it has been given 
To change and be adored for ever.....
Envy not this dim world, for never
But once within the [shadow?] [??]
   One   fair  as     for [sing?] [no  other?]
She left me at the silent time
When the moon had also ceased to climb
          <st>path</st>
The azure <st>dome</st> of Heaven's <st>deep,</st> steep  
And like an albatross asleep
<st>[Hover?]</st> Balanced on her wings of light 
Hovered in the purple night__
<st> And I who sat beside her put </st> 
            sought her [dream?] //It can't be dream because it needs to be two syllables...--VF
Ere she <st>went to seek her</st> nest 
In the chamber of the west.______
                      staid                
She left me, and I <st>sat</st> alone
Thinking over every tone, 
Which though were slient to the ear 
The enchanted heart could hear
                past
<st> Like music [phrases?] which [can]</st> 
Like notes which die when born, but still 
Haunt the [echoes?] of the hill: 
And <st>the</st> [feeling?] [ever?] too much 
The soft vibrations of her touch
<st>Even</st> as if her gentle hand even now
Lightly <st>placed</st> trembles on My brow

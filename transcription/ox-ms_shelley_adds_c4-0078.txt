So when [from?] it has been given 
To change of her adored for ever.....
Envy not this dim mind, for never
but only written oh, [hang?] in [glos?]
   from   [this?]  as
The  left     [??]  if the
When the morn had also ceased to climb

The a [pirs?] <st>dome</st> of Heaven's <st>[depth?]</st>, steep
And like an [albatross?] asleep
[??] [??] on her wings of light
[??] in the [??] bright
<st> And I who [??] beside her best </st>
The [??] <st> when to [??] the rest </st>
In the chamber of the heart.______

                      fair    coquette of Heaven,
Bright wanderer, <st>ivory</st> <st>change</st> //Don't think it's "ivory;" that's not a Percy "i." living/loving maybe? Maybe it's a b.--VF

<st> Like music [p??] which can</st>
Like notes which the [??] from hold still
[Mount?] the [??] of the hill
And <st>the</st> [falling?][were?] / too [much?]
The soft vibrations of her truth
[??] as if her gentle bend were from
dignity <st>placed</st> [heedless?]in [??] from

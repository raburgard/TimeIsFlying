          faint
In my <st>weak</st> heart. I dare not speak
<st>Tho</st> My thoughts; but thus disturbed & weak
I sat and watched the vessels glide
Along the ocean bright & wide
                    our
<str>Like [when?]; its of an element
[??] [??]</st> //Illegible? The more I look the less like words these seem. Is that a capital letter then a t? an H? is the 2nd/3rd character a y or a g? Is that 1 word or 2? I just have no clue.
Like spirit winged chariots sent
              serenest
O'er some <str>dimmer</str> element
For ministrations strange & far;
As if to some Elysian star
They <st>sailed for some [clime?]</st> //Olive or clime, and neither feels right.
     sailed for drink to medicine
Such sweet & bitter pain as mine.
<st>I saw there dark rocks
I watched the dark rocks [p??] & yawn</st>
And the wind that <st>for</st> winged their flight
From the land came fresh & light //The lines that follow are all struck out. They seem to have been struck out after the fact, as Percy made some internal corrections. 
Is <st>on</st> that on the sister sand
Which [??] sea & land
Like when
<st>Why</st> a thread of moonlight <st>lay</st>
<st>When</st> In the <st>[disentangled?] spring</st>
                         [mu??];

I sat and watched the [??] glide
Along the ocean bright & wide

[??] spirits</st> //Illegible?
Like spirit winged chariots sent
              serenest
O'er some <str>dimmer</str> element
For ministrations strange & far;
As if to some Elysian star

     sailed for drink to medicine
Such sweet & bitter pain as mine.
<st>I saw [them?] [dash?] [??]
I watched [them?] [??] [??] & years</st>
And the wind that <st>for</st> winged their flight
From the land came fresh & light //The lines that follow are all struck out. They seem to have been struck out after the fact, as Percy made some internal corrections.
